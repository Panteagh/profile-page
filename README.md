## About this submission
This repository contains a small profile page created for a job application.  
Goal: deliver a polished, accessible, and responsive single-page profile component that demonstrates frontend skills (layout, styling, responsiveness, accessibility, small animations).

**Implemented sections**
- Header (name, role)  
- Avatar with subtle colored shadow / glow  
- About me section (short bio)  
- Two social buttons (configurable links)  
- Responsive layout and basic accessibility (alt attributes, focus states)

**Notes on implementation**
- This project intentionally keeps architecture simple (single-page, componentized) to match the task requirements.
- I implemented UI polish (spacing, typography, subtle motion) while keeping the code understandable and commented.
- Time spent: ~5h — replace with your actual time.

## Tech stack
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
